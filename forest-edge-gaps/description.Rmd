This code calculates the distance to the forest edge and the size of the upwind gap for each individual forest pixel in a forest raster, in the four cardinal directions. A suite of requirements are chosen and applied in the code to discard forest pixels with insufficient number of trees, small tree height, and to limit the distance over which the forest edge is searched for, and to discard forest pixels
